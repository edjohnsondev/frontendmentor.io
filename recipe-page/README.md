## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap grid
- SCSS with maps and mixins

### What I learned

On this project, I played around with using SCSS maps, functions, and mixins to make my styles much more modular and maintainable. Rather than hardcoding colors, spacing, or typography, I set up centralized SCSS maps for my palette and spacing scale, then wrote utility functions to reference these values throughout the stylesheets. This let me keep everything consistent and easy to update.

I also used mixins for things like responsive breakpoints and typography presets, which made it simple to apply consistent font styles and quickly adjust layouts for different screen sizes. Overall, mixing in these SCSS techniques made my codebase more flexible, easier to read, and set up for future improvements.

### Continued development

In future projects, I'd like to take this approach further by exploring even more advanced SCSS patterns and continuing to refine my design system for accessibility and scalability.
